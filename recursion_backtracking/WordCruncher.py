# Letâ€™s define a connected area in a matrix as an area of cells in which there is a
# path between every two cells.
# Write a program to find all connected areas in a matrix.
# Input
#     On the first line, you will get the number of rows.
#     On the second line, you will get the number of columns.
#     The rest of the input will be the actual matrix.
# Output
# Print each of them found ways to form the required string as shown
# in the examples
